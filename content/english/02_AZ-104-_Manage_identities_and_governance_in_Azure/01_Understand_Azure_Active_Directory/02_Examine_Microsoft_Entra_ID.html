  Students should be familiar with Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS or traditionally called just "Active Directory"). AD DS is a directory service that provides the methods for storing directory data, such as user accounts and passwords, and makes this data available to network users, administrators, and other devices and services. It runs as a service on Windows Server, referred to as a domain controller.
 </p>
 <p>
  Microsoft Entra ID is part of the platform as a service (PaaS) offering and operates as a Microsoft-managed directory service in the cloud. Itâ€™s not a part of the core infrastructure that customers own and manage, nor is it an Infrastructure as a service offering. While this implies that you have less control over its implementation, it also means that you donâ€™t have to dedicate resources to its deployment or maintenance.
 </p>
 <p>
  With Microsoft Entra ID, you also have access to a set of features that arenâ€™t natively available in AD DS, such as support for multi-factor authentication, identity protection, and self-service password reset.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can use Microsoft Entra ID to provide more secure access to cloud-based resources for organizations and individuals by:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Configuring access to applications
  </li>
  <li>
   Configuring single sign-on (SSO) to cloud-based SaaS applications
  </li>
  <li>
   Managing users and groups
  </li>
  <li>
   Provisioning users
  </li>
  <li>
   Enabling federation between organizations
  </li>
  <li>
   Providing an identity management solution
  </li>
  <li>
   Identifying irregular sign-in activity
  </li>
  <li>
   Configuring multi-factor authentication
  </li>
  <li>
   Extending existing on-premises Active Directory implementations to Microsoft Entra ID
  </li>
  <li>
   Configuring Application Proxy for cloud and local applications
  </li>
  <li>
   Configuring Conditional Access for users and devices
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Microsoft Entra constitutes a separate Azure service. Its most elementary form, which any new Azure subscription includes automatically, doesn't incur any extra cost and is referred to as the Free tier. If you subscribe to any Microsoft Online business services (for example, Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Intune), you automatically get Microsoft Entra ID with access to all the Free features.
 </p>
 <div class="alert is-info">
  <p class="alert-title">
   Note
  </p>
  <p>
   By default, when you create a new Azure subscription by using a Microsoft account, the subscription automatically includes a new Microsoft Entra tenant named Default Directory.
  </p>
 </div>
 <p>
  Some of the more advanced identity management features require paid versions of Microsoft Entra ID, offered in the form of Basic and Premium tiers. Some of these features are also automatically included in Microsoft Entra instances generated as part of Microsoft 365 subscriptions. Differences between Microsoft Entra versions are discussed later in this module.
 </p>
 <p>
  Implementing Microsoft Entra ID isn't the same as deploying virtual machines in Azure, adding AD DS, and then deploying some domain controllers for a new forest and domain. Microsoft Entra ID is a different service, much more focused on providing identity management services to web-based apps, unlike AD DS, which is more focused on on-premises apps.
 </p>
 <h3 id="microsoft-entra-tenants">
  Microsoft Entra tenants
 </h3>
 <p>
  Unlike AD DS, Microsoft Entra ID is multi-tenant by design and is implemented specifically to ensure isolation between its individual directory instances. Itâ€™s the worldâ€™s largest multi-tenant directory, hosting over a million directory services instances, with billions of authentication requests per week. The term tenant in this context typically represents a company or organization that signed up for a subscription to a Microsoft cloud-based service such as Microsoft 365, Intune, or Azure, each of which uses Microsoft Entra ID. However, from a technical standpoint, the term tenant represents an individual Microsoft Entra instance. Within an Azure subscription, you can create multiple Microsoft Entra tenants. Having multiple Microsoft Entra tenants might be convenient if you want to test Microsoft Entra functionality in one tenant without affecting the others.
 </p>
 <p>
  At any given time, an Azure subscription must be associated with one, and only one, Microsoft Entra tenant. This association allows you to grant permissions to resources in the Azure subscription (via RBAC) to users, groups, and applications that exist in that particular Microsoft Entra tenant.
 </p>
 <div class="alert is-info">
  <p class="alert-title">
   Note
  </p>
  <p>
   You can associate the same Microsoft Entra tenant with multiple Azure subscriptions. This allows you to use the same users, groups, and applications to manage resources across multiple Azure subscriptions.
  </p>
 </div>
 <p>
  Each Microsoft Entra tenant is assigned the default Domain Name System (DNS) domain name, consisting of a unique prefix. The prefix, derived from the name of the Microsoft account you use to create an Azure subscription or provided explicitly when creating a Microsoft Entra tenant, is followed by the
  <strong>
   onmicrosoft.com
  </strong>
  suffix. Adding at least one custom domain name to the same Microsoft Entra tenant is possible and common. This name utilizes the DNS domain namespace that the corresponding company or organization owns. The Microsoft Entra tenant serves as the security boundary and a container for Microsoft Entra objects such as users, groups, and applications. A single Microsoft Entra tenant can support multiple Azure subscriptions.
 </p>
 <h3 id="microsoft-entra-schema">
  Microsoft Entra schema
 </h3>
 <p>
  The Microsoft Entra schema contains fewer object types than that of AD DS. Most notably, it doesn't include a definition of the computer class, although it does include the device class. The process of joining devices to Microsoft Entra differs considerably from the process of joining computers to AD DS. The Microsoft Entra schema is also easily extensible, and its extensions are fully reversible.
 </p>
 <p>
  The lack of support for the traditional computer domain membership means that you can't use Microsoft Entra ID to manage computers or user settings by using traditional management techniques, such as Group Policy Objects (GPOs). Instead, Microsoft Entra ID and its services define a concept of modern management. Microsoft Entra IDâ€™s primary strength lies in providing directory services; storing and publishing user, device, and application data; and handling the authentication and authorization of the users, devices, and applications. The effectiveness and efficiency of these features are apparent based on existing deployments of cloud services such as Microsoft 365, which rely on Microsoft Entra ID as their identity provider and support millions of users.
 </p>
 <p>
  Microsoft Entra ID doesn't include the organizational unit (OU) class, which means that you can't arrange its objects into a hierarchy of custom containers, which is frequently used in on-premises AD DS deployments. However, this isn't a significant shortcoming, because OUs in AD DS are used primarily for Group Policy scoping and delegation. You can accomplish equivalent arrangements by organizing objects based on their group membership.
 </p>
 <p>
  Objects of the Application and servicePrincipal classes represent applications in Microsoft Entra ID. An object in the Application class contains an application definition and an object in the servicePrincipal class constitutes its instance in the current Microsoft Entra tenant. Separating these two sets of characteristics allows you to define an application in one tenant and use it across multiple tenants by creating a service principal object for this application in each tenant. Microsoft Entra ID creates the service principal object when you register the corresponding application in that Microsoft Entra tenant.
